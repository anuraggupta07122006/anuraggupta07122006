## 💡 About Me

I’m a self-motivated AI/ML student from Kanpur with a passion for blending intelligent systems with interactive web technologies. I thrive at the intersection of data, logic, and design — whether it’s building models in Python or crafting user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I’m constantly improving my coding and problem-solving skills through platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, while also working on real-world projects and hackathons to apply what I learn.
